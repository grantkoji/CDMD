  def general_instructions
    puts "GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:::"
    puts "Timer: 7.5 minutes per team playing. Time does not start until after the Pregame Wine and Cheese Reception. Time stops between rounds and for penalties. The referee may stop time at will, for example, if a challenge will take longer than 4 minutes."
    puts " Ritual of Sportsmanship: The Pregame Wine and Cheese Reception is necessary to give the illusion of respect for the other team(s). One glass MUST be consumed by each player at this time. Schubert Moment Musicaux No. 3 in F Minor MUST be played on-loop at this time."
    puts "Team flag raising ceremony with single instrument performance. Preferably the musician is terrible. Don’t forget the Haka!"
    puts "No questions are allowed while time is running. If asked, all members of the asker’s team must chug their drinks for 5 seconds. The first team to reach Level 2 gets to count. If that first team is caught breaking this rule, then the second team gets to count—the torch can be passed only through intention to deceive; SHAME! Questions may be asked between rounds during intermissions."
  end

  def level_instructions
    puts "LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS:::"
    puts "There are three levels to the game: Level 1 Mind, Level 2 Body, and Level 3 Spirit (no Level 4 Horror). Everyone starts in Mind. When a team advances to the next level, that team’s character tokens are placed in the next circle."
    puts "Teams advance in level by obtaining cards. 5 cards are required to advance from Mind to Body, 4 from Body to Spirit, and 3 to win. Cards are obtained through challenges."
    puts "Chance to steal: If a team decidedly fails a card’s instructions, other team with the least cards at the same level have a chance to steal. Coin-flips on who goes next."
    puts "Subsect: If a card involves all players or one player from each team, there is no chance to steal."
  end

  def cheating_rules
    puts "CHEATING RULES:::"
    puts "2 Team Game: If a team is caught cheating, the other team advances to the cheaters’ current level"
    puts "Multiple Teams: Cheating team loses all cards on their current and previous level and moves back to the beginning of the previous level."
    puts "If the team is caught cheating in Level 1, the cheating team loses all cards and all other teams advance one level."\
  end

  def penalties
    puts "PENALTIES:::"
    puts "If someone spills his/her drink, the team of the spilled must chug ALL other drinks –includes members of all other teams regardless of level."
    puts "If teams are uneven, such as one team of three and one team of two, for penalties and requirements of ‘finishing all the drinks of the opposing team,’ the larger team will consume one average drink for each additional person on their own team to even the playing field."
    puts "Trivia cards in Level 1 have the answer written on them. The team of the person who drew the card must answer correctly, or else the opponents have a chance to steal."
    puts "Swearing is not allowed after a team reaches Level 2. As with questions in 1.d., all members of the swearer’s team must chug their drinks for 5 seconds. The first team to reach Level 2 gets to count. If that first team is caught breaking this rule, then the second team gets to count—the torch can be passed only through intention to deceive; SHAME!"
    puts "In Level 3, if you draw a card and are not willing to perform the task AND no opposing teams act on the chance to steal, then everyone playing the game must take a shot."
    puts "If the Level 3 card already lists a penalty (like another shot) for failing to earn it, then the drawer of the card or team of the drawer of the card with no sticktoitiveness must perform all additional penalties listed; whereas the opposing teams do not."
    puts "Anyone who uses their phone while time is running must chug for 5 seconds."
    puts " If the game is played on St. Patrick’s Day, anyone not wearing green must take a shot of their liquor of choice during the Pregame Wine and Cheese Reception."
  end

  def vomitting_policy
    puts "VOMITING POLICY:::"
    puts "No vomiting! As this is a drinking game, and the goal is to get drunk, then vomiting is to be punished. Any player who vomits from alcohol consumption must consume a greater or equal volume of that which was expelled from his/her body. Exceptions are made when the purpose of the activity is to vomit."
  end

  def details_and_miscellaneous
    puts "DETAILS AND MISCELLANEOUS:::"
    puts "Wine is served in Level 1. Beer is served in Level 2. Liquor is served in Level 3. Teams switch over to the new liquids individually advancing from level to level."
    puts "Each Level has its own set of cards."
    puts "CHANCE cards are split and mixed evenly between all three levels before the start of every game by a neutral party (referee)."
    puts "CHANCE cards DO NOT count towards completing levels, yet not following through with the card will result in a penalty shot."
    puts "If the CHANCE card already lists a penalty (like another shot) for failing to earn it, then the player with no sticktoitiveness must perform all penalties"
    puts "You cannot take a penalty shot to get out of jail. You must go directly to jail. You cannot pass go. You cannot collect $200."
    puts "Cards ideally are identical in look/feel to minimize cheating."
    puts "If a card says “until the end of the round,” and is the round winning card, the task carries over to the end of the next round."
    puts "Each time a team earns a card, the other team members have to take a sip of their drinks."
    puts "A team advancing to the next round must finish whatever it is that is currently considered his/her own drink."
    puts "Nobody wants to hear your opinion:"
      puts "Should a player/teammate comment that a card is “easy”, they must take a shot and complete the challenge."
      puts "Concurrently, should an opponent say it, the opponent must complete the challenge or face the penalty of a shot (no card may be won). After the opponent’s action, the original drawer of the card may either complete the original challenge or draw a new card."
      puts "If the card was an 'All Play' or 'One Player From Each Team,' then a new card must be drawn."
    puts "If a team loses a card or fails to keep it in pristine condition, then the card no longer counts for them. Say, for example, the team is in Level 2 but spills beer all over its cards from Level 1: that team must now go back to Level 1 to re-earn the cards. The team may then return to its original point in Level 2. If a team damages a CHANCE card, it counts negatively for the Level the team is currently at."

  def last_minute_rules
    puts "LAST MINUTE RULES"
    puts "Richard Garfield Corollary: If the rules say to do one thing and a card says something different, the card wins."
    puts " Anything that is not clear like a ‘who goes first sorta thing,’ will be settled by a Coin Flip or series of Coin Flips."
    puts "Throughout the various cards—particularly in Level 2—there are nondescript examples of players taking paces. To settle arguments around the definition of what exactly a pace is, the players of CharDee MacDennis will use the measurement of pace as provided by Wikipedia:"
    puts ""
    puts "A pace is a unit of length consisting either of one normal walking step (~0.75 m), or of a double step, returning to the same foot (~1.5 m). Like other traditional measurements, paces started as informal units but have since been standardized, often with the specific length set according to a typical brisk or military marching stride. In the US, it is an uncommon customary unit of length denoting a brisk single step and equal to 21⁄2 feet or 30 inches (76.2 cm). Pace also refers to the inverse unit of speed, used mainly for walking and running. The most common pace unit is minutes per mile."

  def ending_the_game
    puts "ENDING THE GAME OF GAMES"
    puts "The winning team of the game gets to do whatever they want to the flags and game pieces of all other participants."
    puts "Should the game run out of time and there is more than one team in Level 3, the Black Card must be drawn."
